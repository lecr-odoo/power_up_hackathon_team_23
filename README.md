# This is a basic chatbot that illustrates the use of AI in helping students learn and ask questions related to the topics at hand.
# There is a filter that has been put in place to make sure that the response received or the prompt sent in by the user does not contain any blacklisted words.
# The list of blacklisted words can be expanded on.
# The chatbot also logs the user interactions with it.
